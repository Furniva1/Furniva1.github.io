# The Plane Game

ai generated code for a concept website

## Description

This was going to be an attempt at a no code personal website.  Actually, I needed to understand many
coding concepts to make this work properly, and it took a lot of trial and error to make that plane
fly within the screen dimensions.  In the end, I found it entertaining especially as it was a first 
completed website that I could post publically.  I trialed many different ai tools to make the site,
some were better than others, but none of them could pull this off on their own.  I'm not sure if my
prompting needs to be clearer, but many times the ai wants to argue with me about how to make the code
work?  The game is simple, hit the start button, the plane follows your mouse movements and makes several
passes through the screen.  Avoid the buildings and be congradulated!  Hope you enjoy.
